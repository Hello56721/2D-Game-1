# 2D-Game-1
This is a 2D Game I made using OpenGL. It is pretty simple, and my first OpenGL program.
It is also an Eclipse CDT project, so if you want to build it from source, you need that. 
It also requires GLFW and LLVM Clang, so you need to install those and install the LLVM Compiler
family support for eclipse.
