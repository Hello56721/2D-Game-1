# 2D-Game-1
This is a 2D Game I made using OpenGL. It is pretty simple, and my first OpenGL program.<br>
It also need the following library which are not included:<br>
<ul>
  <li>GLFW include</li>
  <li>GLAD include</li>
</ul>

You will need to get those libraries yourself. If you don't bother to compile the source code, then you can get a prebuilt binary for windows in the "Debug" folder
